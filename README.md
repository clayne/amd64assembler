# amd64assembler
Header library for assembling amd64 assembly in C++

# Licensing
I used the strongest copy-left license available on github to discourage corporations from using this code base. I am more than happy to make this available for personal projects with no licensing. Please contact me for details.

# Status
This project is currently only on github for tracking purposes and will not build without the private external libraries it includes. At some point, I will make those available as well.
